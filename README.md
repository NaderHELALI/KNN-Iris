# KNN-Iris
KNN is a non-parametric and lazy learning algorithm. Non-parametric means there is no assumption for underlying data distribution.
In other words, the model structure determined from the dataset. This will be very helpful in practice where most of the real world datasets do not follow mathematical
theoretical assumptions. Lazy algorithm means it does not need any training data points for model generation. All training data used in the testing phase. 
This makes training faster and testing phase slower and costlier. Costly testing phase means time and memory. In the worst case, 
KNN needs more time to scan all data points and scanning all data points will require more memory for storing training data.
